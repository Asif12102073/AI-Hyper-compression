# AI-Hyper-compression
A unique array of Neural networks to tackle data compression(with loss) for ordered data with minimal entropy. Currently this algorithm can compress any image of functions (2 variables) or any ordered image and achieve a high compression ratio due to only storing the model weights. It uses a hypernetwork of NN (multiple models on different patches)
